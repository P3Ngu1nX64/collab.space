#Learn Python 3 the Hard Way
__###Python Learning - collab.space####__

The primary instruction resource is based on a PDF extraction of a book and online HTML webpage tutorial by the author __Zed Shaw__.
collab.space in no way takes credit for the uploaded PDF. It is courtesy of [learnpythonthehardway.org](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/), and it is incorporated into this GitHub directory solely for the purpose of reference.


##Exercises
The following section will be concerned with the exercises of the tutorial: Learn Python 3 the Hard Way. It includes annotations of the self-explanatory tutorial rather than explanations.
Disclaimer: The set up process is very sophisticated, along with its Command Line Crash Course (in the appendix, page 288), could be put into a separate tutorial. Therefore, it will not be incorporated into this tutorial. Therefore, our first exercise will be on Page 34 of the PDF.
Here is a short Table of Contents. _(Subject to change)_
