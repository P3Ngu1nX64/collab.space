# collab.space
A space purely designed for miscellaneous snippets and free development.

With each new idea, code snippet, or small project, a new folder will be created to enclose it. These individual folders can be mutually unrelated and each individual folder should have their own __README.md__ file.

_This is a open source repository, feel free to test your code ideas._

     "C++ is the best coding language."
                                      -Eric Chen (2019)
