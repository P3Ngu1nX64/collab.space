# SPANISH ENGLIFYER
### Engineered for Annoyance
##### An exploration of Dictionaries, Classes, and JSON File Structures.

<br />

## Purpose

This Project was _purely_ written for fun. It is the simplest text replacer that operated on reading and writing to a compact plain-text Dictionary in a `.json` file.

It was also practice for creating object-oriented code (using classes entitled `Dictionary` and `Language`), and it is expandable for repurposing in the future.

A help menu could be accessed when you run the program. If you used the **"Add Words"** function to append to the dictionary, feel free to update the `dict.json` file here if you wish to. The more words we can collect, the "_memier_".

## Documentation

To use this script, download the folder `esp2eng`, alternatively you can just download the `run.py` and `dict.json` files, but make sure to keep them in the same directory, or else the script won't be able to access the Dictionary.

Execute the script any way you want, make sure that your _path of working directory_ is _**same**_ as the location of `run.py` and `dict.json`, which is inside the folder `esp2eng` if you downloaded the entire file.

For example, to run the program on Terminal, excecute the following command

```bash
python3 run.py
```

- [ ] reminder to integrate colon and brackets `:` , `(`,`)`
