# Work In Progress: Pygame

## Organization:

There are two files of reference: Making Games by Al Zweigart and Pygame's documentation. The pygame documentation for pygame 1.9.2 goes through each individual module and explains every function of that module in brief. Therefore, a chapter (module) of the documentation will be referenced throughout the chapters whenever appropriate - when its contents are mentioned my the book. The organization will be by chapters.

Notes: Chapter 1 is equivalent to Chapter 2 of the book, as the book's chapter 1 only goes through how to install python and pygame.
